**Subject:** From Spreadsheet Chaos to Client Intelligence: PADSquad Data Automation Architecture

---

Dan,

Thank you for the conversation yesterday. The challenge you described (client data arriving in three different formats, account managers spending hours on manual normalization before they can generate reports) is a problem I know how to solve.

Rather than send you a traditional 30/60/90 plan, I built something more useful: a working architecture for how I'd automate your reporting pipeline using the infrastructure you already have in place.

**Live case study:** [INSERT NETLIFY URL HERE]

The solution leverages 95% of your existing stack (Salesforce + Tableau) and adds one intelligent layer for AI-powered field mapping. The result is 90%+ time savings on report generation, freeing your account managers to do strategic client work instead of data wrangling.

Key architectural decisions:
- **Salesforce Email-to-Case** for data ingestion (no new tool)
- **Tableau Prep Builder** for ETL across three client formats (you already have this)
- **AI normalization layer** (Einstein or Claude API) for intelligent field mapping
- **Salesforce Custom Object** as single source of truth
- **Tableau dashboards** for automated, branded PDF reports

The case study walks through the full pipeline (using Home Depot, McDonald's, and Toyota as examples), includes an interactive ROI calculator, and lays out a 90-day implementation roadmap.

I know you're planning to share this with your SVP of Tech. The architecture is designed to demonstrate both strategic thinking and technical execution.

Happy to discuss any part of this in detail.

Kelly
